Graceful degradation and the concept of service workers are related in a major way: the idea behind graceful degradation is to work top-down where we ensure that a web application maintains core functionality even when certain technologies including JavaScript fail -- in the case with service workers, we are doing something similar by caching the data/website data when we last had a network connection so that in the case that a feature or piece of technology fails, you retain the ability to visit the website and webpages as it last was. Service workers may be used as part of an implementation of graceful degradation.
